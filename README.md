# Travix test

## Description

The aim of the test is to develop a mini-application for managing tasks.

We should be at least able to create, modify and delete a task.

A server has been implemented with Express. It offers the functionalities expected.

However this server is not perfect. It could be improved and tested as well.

So your mission is to develop the front-end from scratch using a famous front-end framework.

We are also expecting from you a usable, responsive UI.

### Bonus

* unit-tests for the UI 
* integration-test (one (or more) just in order to show that you know what is it (: )
* evolution - unit-tests for the server
* dynamic-ui (web-sockets...?)
* using the `made in Travix` technologies
* ... Impress us !

## Requirements

* React 14+
* Redux or Flux or Frint or whateverelse with a one-way data flow
* SASS or LESS
* Must be responsive
* We have big tasks files for testing the application (very huge)
